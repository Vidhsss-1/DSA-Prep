# 🚀 DSA Prep in Java — My Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning repository**!
This repo documents my complete journey — from mastering the basics to solving complex problems — all implemented in **Java**.
It reflects my *growth mindset, problem-solving ability, and consistency* as a learner.
